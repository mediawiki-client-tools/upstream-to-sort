# Upstream to Sort

This repository contains the parts of [`wikiteam`](https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam/) that haven't become part of [`mediawiki-dump-generator`](https://github.com/mediawiki-client-tools/mediawiki-dump-generator/) so that we can remove them from the main branch without completely forgetting they exist.

The code in this repository probably doesn't work, but it may be possible to make it compatible with `mediawiki-dump-generator`.

> **Note:** This repository still has the config files for [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) and [`markdownlint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) if you'd like to use them to check your code.
